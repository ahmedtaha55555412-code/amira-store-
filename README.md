# أميرة استور — Greenfield ZCode Execution Pack

هذا الإصدار مخصص لمشروع جديد بالكامل يبدأ من Workspace فارغ. لا يحتاج إلى أي Repository قديم.

ابدأ من `ZAI_GREENFIELD_BOOTSTRAP.md` ثم `AGENTS.md`.

# أميرة استور — AI Execution Plan

This package contains the complete gated execution system for the Amira Store project.

## Start here
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `MASTER_PLAN.md`
3. `EXECUTION_STATUS.md`
4. `ZAI_BOOTSTRAP.md`
5. `docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md`
6. `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
7. `docs/ops/ERROR_PROTOCOL.md`
8. `docs/qa/TRACEABILITY.md`
9. `docs/qa/FINAL_ACCEPTANCE.md`
10. `docs/phases/PHASE-00.md` through `PHASE-15.md`

## Important execution design
The project is deliberately not encoded as one giant prompt. `AGENTS.md` is intentionally short and authoritative, while detailed requirements live in `MASTER_PLAN.md` and bounded phase files. The agent must execute exactly one phase at a time and stop after its gate passes.
